# main
This is the application, which runs on `black.box` devices. This code purposefully does not contain OpenVPN configuration, API back-end, deployment scripts, etc. as these are usually crafted for each specific purpose. It should however give an idea of how the OpenVPN client is driven by the Python program and what inputs/outputs it expects.
