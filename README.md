`black.box` is a VPN policy routing appliance, which runs on [Raspberry Pi(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi),
[DD-WRT](https://privacyapp.flashrouters.com/) routers and other[[n8](#footnotes)] devices. <img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/black.box/master/images/unzoner.jpg" width="125">

`Unzoner` is a subscription-based service, which helps connect `black.box(es)` with
exit-nodes in target geographical regions.

`black.box` + `Unzoner` un-block video streaming content across [tablets](https://www.unzoner.com/#ios), [smartphones](https://www.unzoner.com/#android), [desktops](http://unzoner.com/#kodi), [laptops](http://unzoner.com/#tunnelblick-and-windows)

# about
`black.box` devices operate in three distinct modes. Devices connected to the `black.box`
Wi-Fi network or routed via the device's Ethernet (LAN) IP address, can (a) typically
access popular streaming [services](#services) from anywhere in the world; (b) to provide
privacy and anonymity via 3rd party VPN providers; or (c) etablish private VPN links
between two or more locations. Application source code is [available](https://github.com/ab77/black.box/tree/master/unzoner)
under the [MIT](https://github.com/belodetek/black.box/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

## unblocking mode (default)
In the default un-blocking mode, coupled with an active unzoner subscription, `black.box`
device allows access to popular streaming [services](#services) in the target region from
anywhere in the world. In this mode, the device additionally supports
obfuscation/cloaking, in order to function in hostile deep packet inspection (DPI)
environments, as well as experimental WAN acceleration mode.

PayPal subscription or Bitcoin credit is required to create a subscription. Subscriptions
are priced at **â‚¬9.95** per month, with initial **1 month free** (if paid by PayPal).
PayPal subscriptions can be [cancelled](#cancellation) at any time.

Alternatively, pay up-front using Bitcoin for as much time as you need. Price quoted based
on EUR/BTC exchange rate. Top-up at any point prior to the existing Bitcoin credit expiry,
or after. Any unused Bitcoin credit will be rolled over if topping up prior to existing
credit expiry. Topping up after credit expiry will strike a new exchange rate.

For performance reasons, un-blocking traffic is not encrypted[[n4](#footnotes)]. When
policy routing is enabled (default), all traffic goes out via the local Internet
interface, except for selected services. When disabled, all traffic is sent via the
tunnel, except for selected services. For security reasons, the tunnel interface may be
restricted to only allow specific network ports[[n1](#footnotes)] for streaming, while the
local interface is always unrestricted.

## VPN mode
In VPN mode, the device supports a number of popular VPN services, such as [VPNArea](http://vpnarea.com/front?a_aid=blackbox)
and [Private Internet Access](https://privateinternetaccess.com).
Separate subscriptions/accounts required to access supported VPN services.

## server (pairing) mode
In the server pairing mode, multiple devices can be used to establish private encrypted
links. Leave one at home/office and dial back in securely when travelling or on holidays
to access the Internet via the device in server mode. `Unzoner` subscription is currently
not required in this mode. LAN(s) behind server devices are not accessible (WAN only).

# dashboard
Once the device is running, the dash is accessible by navigating to [http://blackbox.local/](http://blackbox.local/)
while connected to the `black.box` Wi-Fi network or from the LAN. Please do not share your
device GUID(s) (the long alpa-numeric string you see in the dash URL) as they are
effectively credentials for anyone to access your devices settings and modify them. So,
keep them secret.

A live demo dashboard is available [here](https://dashboard.unzoner.com/?guid=b55b561ea8fcc9b11105f05f1e8b5095).

![black.box dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/black.box/master/images/dashboard.png)

If multiple regions are available to un-block, click a country flag in the top right
corner of the [dash](#dashboard). The device will re-boot with the new settings and
un-block the selected country.

# services
A number of popular services can be selected on the [dash](#dashboard). If the service you
require is missing please, email [support](mailto:blackbox@unzoner.com), IRC channel [#netflix-proxy](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#netflix-proxy)
on Freenode or use the live chat link on the dash to request it. Also, disabling
`Policy Routing` (optionally disabling `Local DNS`) as well as setting all `Services` to
`none` will make unknown services work.

# cancellation
Please visit PayPal to cancel your `black.box` subscription.

# Tomato
Support for [Tomato](https://www.flashrouters.com/learn/router-basics/what-is-tomato) flashed routers is (maybe) planned in the future.

# technical architecture
`black.box` appliances can functions in a number of modes. In the default `un-blocking`
mode, the device automatically connects to the least busy `black.box` exit-node in the
target region and routes traffic through the tunnel, while advertising a local Wi-Fi AP to
all consumer devices within range.

In `server` mode, the device advertises its private `GUID` and listens for incoming VPN
connections from paired device(s). Device(s) in `paired` mode, which have specified the
private `GUID` in their configuration, locate and connect to the `server` node, while
advertising a local Wi-Fi AP to all consumer devices within range. This mode is useful for
establishing point to point links betwen two of more locations.

In `VPN` mode, the device supports connecting to a number of popular VPN services, such as
[PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/), [VPNArea](https://vpnarea.com/) and [VanishedVPN](https://www.vanishedvpn.com.au/). Additional VPN providers can be easily integrated.

There are two more system modes the device can function in, namely `exit-node` and
`double-vpn`. These are suitable for white-labelling of the `black.box` service and are
not available via the dash. In `exit-node` mode, `black.box` devices advertise themselves
to devices running in `un-blocking` mode. This mode is useful for deploying `black.box`
exit-nodes anywhere in the world with an Internet connection and a power socket. In
`double-vpn` mode, devices both listen for incoming VPN client connections, as well as
establish a outbound connection to a down-stream VPN server.

`black.box` devices run on [balenaOS](https://www.balena.io/os/), using [Balena](https://balena.io/) management back-end.
OpenVPN 2.5.x is used for building `black.box` VPN tunnels, whether encrypted or otherwise.
On ARM platforms, OpenSSL is compiled with available optimisations to accelerate certain
cryptographic functions. OpenVPN is linked with optimised SSL libraries. Stunnel and
WANProxy are (optionally) used for obfuscation and/or acceleration. You can expect to get
anywhere from 5Mbit/s upwards through the Pi Ethernet interface in unblocking mode and
less in VPN mode. VPN providers which use default SHA1 authentication should be a little
faster on ARM platforms due to complier optimisations.

Python 3.9 is used for the main application, together with Linux Bash shell scripts to
help interface with the operating system. All Python code is (optionally) compiled into
executables using Nuitka and encrypted using OpenSSL. All devices are managed using
`Balena` IoT infrastructure, which runs the `black.box` code inside Docker ([balena-engine](https://www.balena.io/engine/))
containers on balenaOS. All runtime code is unpacked onto encrypted disk partitions inside
containers with all transient data stored in memory and with encryption keys never stored
in the images.

Amazon AWS (EBS) is used to host both the `black.box` (private) [API](https://api.unzoner.com/api/v1.0/ping) and the device [dashboard](https://dashboard.unzoner.com/?guid=b55b561ea8fcc9b11105f05f1e8b5095),
which are implemented in Python-Flask and Bootstrap. Amazon RDS is used for transient data
storage, persisting for no longer than one hour, and Redis is used for caching. If you
would like to white-label Unzoner, please get in [touch](mailto:team@belodetek.io).

For subscriptions, the `black.box` API talks to the PayPal Subscriptions API to set-up
monthly subscriptions. For Bitcoin payments, the BlockCypher API provides necessary
WebHooks to advise the `black.box` API when a payment has been received as well as a
WebSocket notification for the dashboard. No Bitcoin payment provider (middle-man) is used
in the Bitcoin payment flow.

Additional management VPS is used to provide `ipinfo` support services as well as execute
automated headless video playback tests using  Selenium WebDriver wrapped in Python.

5. The initial application image is currently around 2GB. Subsequent deltas are small.
   Monitor by pinging `blackbox.local` from your LAN. If you have multiple `black.box`
   devices on your LAN/WLAN, the second device will be called `blackbox-2.local`, the
   third `blackbox-3.local` and so on.

6. For additional security, you can locate the device in your DMZ and restrict access to
   your LAN, however the device needs unrestricted oubound access to the Internet. Your
   DMZ should also forward mDNS (avahi-daemon) broadcast packets to your LAN for
   discovery/dashboard access. The device communicates with a private API at AWS over
   HTTPS and a number of OpenVPN endpoints to enable functionality.

7. The dash will automatically refresh after Bitcoin payment has been confirmed. This
   could take a number of minutes, depending on the Bitcoin network load.

8. Supported devices currently include [DD-WRT](https://www.flashrouters.com/learn/router-basics/what-is-dd-wrt) routers,
   [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) and [Intel NUC](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/overview.html).
   If you own a [supported](https://docs.resin.io/hardware/devices/) board, [request](mailto:blackbox@unzoner.com) an image.

9. Try disabling both `Policy Routing` and `Local DNS` on the dash if you are having
   issues with a particular service. If you have router(s) on your network assigning IPv6
   addresses, some IPv6 enabled services may not work (i.e. Netflix). Try disabling IPv6
   on your network if this is the case.

10. Not all SD cards are created equal, see [microSD Card Benchmarks](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/microsd-cards)
    and get a fast one. Don't get a cheap SD card since even if you get the device up and running initially, it will be very slow and will fail catastrophically shortly after.

11. Subscriptions require PayPal support for recurring payments in the country where the
    buyer account is located (excludes Germany and Austria).
